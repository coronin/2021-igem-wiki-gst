                                <p>In May 2020, Fudan University launched <em>Hands Out Free Sanitary Pads in Schools Campaign</em>- women's restrooms in each teaching building are equipped with a sanitary towel mutual aid bag containing one or two separately
                                    packaged sanitary napkins to provide women who forget to bring sanitary napkins to ease the embarrassment. Fudan was not the only university in Shanghai to do so, The intention of the event was good, but it also made
                                    us think: <strong>Will the prolonged placement of sanitary napkins in exposed, moist environments lead to safety problems such as mold breeding?</strong></p>
                                <p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/9/97/T--Fudan--description2.jpg" alt="pic"><br>Figure 1. Sanitary napkins in the women restroom</p>
                                <p>At first our project intended to focus on the detection and safety of sanitary napkins, and to design a sticker that would change color based on the number of bacteria and mold on the surface to indicate whether sanitary
                                    napkins could be used. <strong>Our original project design was to detect germs on the surface of sanitary napkins based on group sensing and cascade the signal with a circuit of synthetic biology.</strong></p>

                                <p>After communicating with our instructor, however, we realized that the original project design had high detection limits and high costs and that the practical value was not great. <strong>We turned our attention from the sanitary napkin to the user's health</strong>,
                                    and after data search, we found that the original vaginal disease causes are very many, the main category is Vulvovaginal Candidiasis after the team members asked us to understand that the original prevalence of vaginal
                                    disease far exceeded our expectations, for the detection of the disease is fully necessary.</p>
                                <p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/65/T--Fudan--Candida.png" alt="pic"><br>Figure 3. Picture of <em>C. albicans</em></p>
                                <p>Candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic fungal infections which affects besides vaginal the skin, nails, bronchial, lungs, and digestive mucosal surfaces acutely, subacute, and chronically (Mirhandi <i>et al</i>. 2006).
                                    Sometimes, the disseminated infection may also occur in the kidneys, liver, and heart (Mirhandi <i>et al</i>. 2006; Chadwick <i>et al</i>. 2013). In immunocompromised patients, the <em>Candida</em> species are among the main causes
                                    of sepsis, and nosocomial bloodstream infections which have been associated with significant mortality (Lion 2017). Also, <em>Candida</em> species can cause infections of the prosthesis, the urinary tract, and the upper
                                    respiratory tract. <em>C. albicans</em> has an indisputable ability to develop human infections, as is the most common fungal infectious agent in humans, the most common fungal agent of hospital infections, and the
                                    fourth cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections among all microbial agents that cause infection (Coronado-Castellote and Jiménez-Soriano 2013; Sherry <i>et al</i>. 2014).</p>
                                <p>Therefore, accurate detection of <em>Candida</em> species has a significant role in the prevention, control, and timely treatment of the disease. Our project focuses on the most common disease caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>                                    among women but may also be applied out of VVC to a broader range of <em>Candida</em> species-caused diseases.</p>

                                <p>The routine diagnosis of <em>Candida albicans</em> in the laboratory is carried out using diagnostic methods such as CHROMagar <em>Candida</em>, germ tube production, chlamydoconidia generation, and carbohydrate assimilation
                                    assays. The CHROMagar <em>Candida</em> medium is cost-effective but requires much time to achieve the results, and this method cannot differentiate all <em>Candida</em> species. The germ tube production method is not
                                    accurate and has false-negative results. Molecular detection methods based on the isolation and amplification of nucleic acids of the fungus include a variety of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, hybridization,
                                    and isothermal amplification technique, which can detect the infection even in the primary stages of the disease. The PCR assay is a fast and reliable method that has not only many advantages but also some limitations
                                    including various temperature cycles, the use of expensive thermocyclers and gel documentation systems, and variable sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this method cannot be used in low-income countries or resource-limited
                                    districts.[1]
                                </p>

                                <p>Since the rapid and accurate identification of <em>C. albicans</em> from the non-<em>albicans</em> species is essential, especially in people who have a recurrent infection, <strong>there's an urgent need to discover cost-effective and user-friendly methods with high sensitivity and specificity to detect <em>C. albicans</em></strong>,
                                    which is also the goal of our project. Above is the origin of our project.</p>
                                <p>We were not the only team to focus on the detection of <em>C. albicans</em>, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovLzIwMTguaWdlbS5vcmcvVGVhbTpVaU9zbG9fTm9yd2F5">Team UiOslo_Norway</span> in 2018 also focused on the detection
                                    of <em>C. albicans</em> using CRISPR/dCas9. While they focused on the accuracy and detection limits, we care about lowering the cost of detection by improving the production of the enzyme entailed in the detection.</p>

                                <h1 id="overview"><a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a> <strong>Overview</strong></h1>
                                <p>As a conditionally pathogenic strain, <i>Candida albicans</i> can colonize on genital/gastrointestinal mucosa without causing disease, and only in immunosuppressed hosts can <i>C. albicans</i> become pathogenic. Vulva vaginal inflammation
                                    caused by <i>Candida</i> infection is one of the most common vulva inflammation in women. [1] However, the existing detection methods still have problems such as low accuracy in clinical testing, high cost, and long cycles
                                    in laboratory testing. So we tried to build a product for the rapid, cheap, and accurate detection of <i>Candida albicans</i>, which can be used in resource-limited regions as well.</p>
                                <p>We used <i>E. coli</i> to over-express the Bst DNA polymerase entailed in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction. Such an enzyme amplifies the specific DNA sequence of <i>Candida albicans</i> to achieve the purpose
                                    of rapid and sensitive detection. Besides, <strong>we designed gene circuits with our core parts gp2 and gp5.7 to suppress the background protein translation and uplift the relative purity of Bst polymerase produced by <i>E. coli</i>, and by fusing Bst with various kinds of DNA binding proteins, we are hoping to reduce the cost of the detection and increase the efficiency simultaneously.</strong></p>
                                <h1 id="isothermal-amplification"><a class="anchor" href="#isothermal-amplification">#</a> Isothermal amplification</h1>
                                <p>The routine diagnosis of <i>Candida albicans</i> in the laboratory is carried out using diagnostic methods such as CHROMagar <i>Candida albicans</i>, germ tube production, chlamydoconidia generation, and carbohydrate assimilation
                                    assays. The CHROMagar Candida medium is cost effective but requires much time to achieve the results, and this method cannot differentiate all Candida species. The germ tube production method is not accurate and has
                                    false-negative results. Molecular detection methods based on the isolation and amplification of nucleic acids of the fungus include a variety of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, hybridization, and isothermal
                                    amplification technique, which can detect the infection even in the primary stages of the disease. The PCR assay is a fast and reliable method that has not only many advantages but also some limitations including various
                                    temperature cycles, the use of expensive thermocyclers and gel documentation system, and variable sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this method cannot be used in low income countries or in resource limited districts.[2]</p>
                                <p>We turned to isothermal ammplification to amplifay the target DNA of <i>C. albicans</i>. Isothermal amplifification of nucleic acids is a simple process that rapidly</p>
                                <p>and efficiently accumulates nucleic acid sequences at constant temperature.</p>
                                <h2 id="loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification-lamp"><a class="anchor" href="#loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification-lamp">#</a> LAMP</h2>
                                <h3 id="why-did-we-choose-lamp"><a class="anchor" href="#why-did-we-choose-lamp">#</a> Why LAMP?</h3>
                                <p>With the aim to create a rapid, specific and cost-effective point-of-care detection system, at first, we needed to find the most suitable isothermal DNA amplification method. This method should be usable for farmers who
                                    have no scientific background. This factor pinpoints a huge need to be able to perform these isothermal reactions with as minimal pipetting steps as possible by means of avoiding errors and false-positive results. Although,
                                    amplification of marker sequences should be done in constant temperature by the needs of cheap and fully-portable equipment.</p>
                                <p>Considering these main requirements, we have distinguished some isothermal amplification methods and concluded that loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique (LAMP) should be the solution for the following reasons.
                                    First, The isothermal amplifification of target species-specifific DNA sequence through LAMP does not require thermocycler thus offers potential advantages of speed, cost, simplicity, and accuracy.[4] Second, LAMP method
                                    is highly sequencing specifific, high amplifification specifificity allows the synthesis of a large amount of DNA in a very short time, the detection limit is few copies per reaction, and requires only a heating block
                                    or a water bath at a constant temperature [5]. Last but not least, LAMP requires simple enzyme as the Bst DNA polymerase which we intended to improve using sythetic biology methods.</p>
                                <p>Comparison between different isothermal amplification methods[3]</p>
                                <p>However, the LAMP method has few limitations, such as LAMP amplifified DNA products can be visualized by gel electrophoresis or other detection methods. However, these methods may require the opening of the reaction tubes
                                    and increase the risk of carry-over contamination and complexity. A one-pot reaction is helpful and the end-product can be visualized with</p>
                                <p>the naked eye, but a naked eye method is not sensitive to variability among various samples and the detection limit is very high and the specificity can't be ensured. We prefered to use the lateral flow asssay to visualize

                                <p>The lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) is an immune chromatographic technique conducted on a lateral flow dipstick (LFD). LFA has been employed successfully to achieve point-of-care diagnostics [7]. LFA is specifific and sensitive,
                                    does not require a specifific instrument. Presently, rapid, sensitive, specifific, and affordable point-of-care tests are needed, especially in places that do not have access to laboratory services.<!--br>~<br>Schematic

                                <p>Purification of protein costs much, and it also leads to the problem of ‘how to transport and store these protein’. However, in our project, the target users are mainly those suffering poverty or living in underdeveloped
                                    regions. They may have no access to institution with lab environment, or just can’t afford the high cost. To cut these expense, we decide to use the extract of our engineered <i>E. coli</i> to directly catalyze the LAMP reaction.
                                    However, there’ll be lots of unrelated proteins in the extract disturbing the reaction, so we need our engineered <i>E. coli</i> to produce our protein of interest, the enzyme, as pure as possible. In another word, we need

                                <p>During the transcription process of <i>E. coli</i>, transcription factors called ‘σ factors (sigma factors)’ are essential for guiding the RNA Polymerase (RNAP) to the promoters and initiating the transcription. We call RNAPs combined
                                    with σ factors ‘RNAP whole enzyme’. Each kinds of σ factors can specifically recognize corresponding promoters, thus realizing the overall regulation of gene expression at transcription level. There are at least seven
                                    kinds of σ factors that respectively be responsible to dominate the whole transcription process of host <i>E. coli</i> at different situations, including regular growth stages and extreme hazard. Among them, σ70 and σS are
                                    two major σ factors of <i>E. coli</i> According to Abhishek Mazumder and Achillefs N. Kapanidis (2019) and Herb E. Schellhorn (2020), σ70 is the so-called ‘housekeeping’ σ factor which controls about 80% genes. In another
                                    word, when the <i>E. coli</i> is in ordinary environment, σ70 will always be the dominant σ factor. On the other hand, σS is the σ factor used by <i>E. coli</i> in order to counter starvation situation. In lab situation, we typically
                                    divide bacteria’s growth into four stages. According to the features of σ70 and σS, σS will take dominance at stationary stage while σ70 will show most significance at exponential stage. However, RNAP of phages, such
                                    as T7 phage’s RNAP, doesn’t necessarily rely on σ factors.</p>
                                <!-- p empty -->
                                <p>So it suddenly dawned on us that we can interfere σ factors to inhibit transcription and use phage’s transcription system to make our protein of interest immune to the inhibition. To interfere σ factors, we think of two
                                    ways. The first one is to let the engineered <i>E. coli</i> express dominant negative mutant of σ factor. But there’re so many kinds of σ factors, and their conserved regions are quite complicated. It’s hard to design an appropriate
                                    dominant negative mutant. Meanwhile, σ factors are quite huge as proteins, overexpress them is contradictory to our aim of reducing irrelevant proteins. The second way is to hinder the ability of σ factors. Then what
                                    we need to do is to find a proper inhibitor.</p>

                                <p>Phage, well-known for being the virus infecting bacteria, is introduced in almost all biology text books in middle school. Briefly as the introduction is, they must tell you one phage’s key feature,’ Phages have the ability
                                    to shut bacteria down and turn them into factories that help phages replicate.’</p>

                                <p>In the field of synthesis biology, expressing systems of phages are good tools to help you achieve high protein yield. Among them, T7 system is one of the most mature expressing systems. However, the typical T7 expressing
                                    system merely utilizing T7 phage’s RNA polymerase, in another word, only materializing phage’s ability to turn bacteria into ‘factories’. Actually, there’s also huge potential in putting phage’s ability of ‘shutting
                                    down’ into expressing system.</p>

                                <p>One of T7’s shutting-down-methods is to inhibit the transcription initialization of bacteria by producing three proteins, respectively called gp2, gp5.7 and gp0.7. This process can redistribute the metabolism pressure of
                                    the host bacteria, letting them save mass and energy to produce what T7 phages want them to produce, meanwhile, reducing the relevant amount of other proteins for sure. That’s exactly the effects we want.</p>

                                <p>Among the three transcription inhibitors mentioned above, gp2 and gp5.7 are both binding proteins of RNAP whole-enzyme, while gp0.7 is a kinase with low specificity. In order to ensure the system’s robustness, we select
                                    gp2 and gp5.7 as candidates for constructing our gene circuit.</p>

                                <p>Gp2 accounts for ‘T7 Gene Product 2’. It’s an gene product produced by <i>E. coli</i> infected by T7 phage at its early stage. According to Brian Bae <i>et al</i>.(2013), gp2 takes effects by simultaneously binding to RNAP β’ subunit
                                    as well as σ70 1.1domain, thus blocking the way DNA should be able to get in. By this process, all transcription process initiated by σ70 can be inhibited.</p>
                                <p>We are not the first team to propose gp2 in iGem community. In iGem 2018, Team: Imperial used T7 gp2 to hinder <i>E. coli</i> from growing without killing them, but they didn’t explain why gp2 can’t kill <i>E. coli</i> We propose two
                                    hypothesis about this question. The first one is that, gp2 can inhibit the transcription of the mRNA of itself, thus reaching a balance. 这里最好放一个 建模的图 The second is that, σS will take over σ70 after gp2 is
                                    expressed, and keep the cell surviving. Therefore, it’s necessary to introduce a σS-RNAP inhibitor to ensure the inhibition effect.</p>

                                    RNAP β’ subunit as well as σS R4 domain. By this process, all transcription process initiated by σS can be inhibited.</p>

                                <p>To prove the effect of gp2 and gp5.7. We need several σ70 promoters and σ70 promoters. While σ70 promoters are everywhere, σS promoters are super rare in iGem community. To solve this problem, we decide to introduce a set
                                    of σS promoters ourselves.</p>
                                <p>According to Regine Hengge-Aronis(2002), the regulation of σS doesn’t only includes the expression of σS. There’s a complicated regulation procedure. According to Anna Macia, <i>et al</i>.(2011), σS promoters usually feature
                                    several UP elements that enable other factors to regulate them. In order to minimize the irrelevant factors, we only cut out about 35bp from those whole σS promoters. Since that might make the promoter lose its properties,
                                    we design an experiment to test and verify all the simplified σS promoters we propose.</p>
                                <p>σS promoters we propose include: csiD, osmY, fic and dps, the sequences of which are shown below.</p>
                                <p>Gisela Becker and Regine Hengge-Aronis(2001) has analyzes several σS promoters sequence and found that they have quite conserved sequences in their simplest form. Since csiD and fic didn’t show as strong evidence of
                                    being σS promoters as dps and osmY, we decide to improve their sequence manually by introducing spot mutation following Gisela Becker and Regine Hengge-Aronis’s results. The sequence of improved promoters are shown

<p>Sso7d is a kind of double-stranded binding protein, and it be used widely to improve the activity of polymerase.
The DNA structure changes at different concentrations of Sso7d and depends on the reaction time. At relatively low concentrations of Sso7d, DNA strands form a kinked structure. When the concentration of Sso7d increases,
DNA loops appear. Finally, DNA becomes a dense nuclear structure at high concentrations of Sso7d. If the time of interaction between Sso7d and DNA increases, the DNA structure tends to be more compact. High concentrations
of Sso7d are important for the compact structure of DNA.
Therefore, Sso7d has an affinity for double-stranded binding proteins and thus recognizes the annealed double-strand, allowing the polymerase to quickly find the extension site, thus effectively increasing the extension
speed of the DNA polymerase.</p>

<p>It has been widely reported in the past that the activity associated with Pfu DNA polymerase can be greatly improved by adding the double-stranded binding protein Sso7d1 to the C-terminus of Pfu DNA polymerase. Meanwhile,
our laboratory has done experiments to improve the activity of DNA polymerase Ⅱ by adding double-stranded binding protein in the past and has accumulated more experience.
In previous studies, Sso7d was suggested to synthesize fusion proteins with DNA polymerase A or DNA polymerase B to largely increase polymerase activity, but no studies have been conducted on the changes in the activity
of DNA polymerase Ⅰ and Sso7d fusion proteins. Even so, we still speculated that the activity of Bst DNA polymerase might be improved by linking double-stranded binding proteins, and selected four double-stranded binding
proteins from the same hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, Sso7d, Sso10b, DbpA and albA1, for our experiments. Based on the results of previous modifications of pfu DNA polymerase, we predicted that
the bst-sso7d fusion protein might possess the highest activity.</p>

                                <h2 id="733"><a class="anchor" href="#733">#</a> <strong>Our selection of binding proteins</strong></h2>
                                <p>We selected six binding proteins for our experiments (two for single-stranded binding protein and four for double-stranded binding protein). We asseumed that just as double-stranded binding proteins can bind annealed double-stranded
                                    DNA, single-stranded binding proteins can also bind denatured single-stranded DNA and thus improve the amplification efficiency of DNA polymerase. In addition to this, we designed two possible twelve-component experiments
                                    by ligating the binding proteins to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of Bst DNA polymerase, respectively, for the experiments. In designing the fusion protein, we chose the flexible linker, (G2S)3, as the linker of
                                    our fusion protein.</p>
                                <p><strong>According to our latest results of our experiments, our modification actually works as we expected.</strong></p>
