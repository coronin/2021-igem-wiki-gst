                                <p>We have developed a generalizable method for measuring bacterial autolysis. During recombinant protein production, overexpression of exogenously sometimes toxic proteins in <em>E. coli</em> imposes a metabolic burden on
                                    the host cells, which further triggers the bacterial stress response, leading to severe cellular autolysis, reduced biomass growth, and decreased recombinant protein in production. Previously, no feasible method to
                                    assess the autolysis rate of <em>E. coli</em>in culture. Here, we use the leaked plasmid as the indicator for lysed bacteria, and optimized protocols to the extra plasmid from bacterial culture media, comparing with
                                    those that could be extracted from bacteria pellets (intact cells). Next, we examine the autolysis during IPTG induction for BL21 (DE3) bacteria, with or without gp5.7 expression. Further, we asked people in a nearby
                                    lab to try our method and to give us their feedback for further improvement.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h1 id="optimization"><a class="anchor" href="#optimization">#</a> Experiments</h1>
                                <h2><a class="anchor" href="#opti">#</a> Optimization</h2>
                                <p>Initially, we tried to make a mixture of EDTA, NaAc, KAc, and acetic acid in a certain ratio and add a certain concentration of purified plasmids to it to simulate the environment of supernatant after bacteriophage lysis
                                    during plasmid extraction. And then we used silica gel membranes to absorb plasmid. However, we could not get any plasmid because the system was too complicated. Considering that the silica gel membrane would selectively
                                    adsorb nucleic acids at high salt (e.g. 4M guanidine hydrochloride) and low pH (e.g. pH 5.0), and would release nucleic acids at low salt and high pH (e.g. pH 8.0), we added Buffer A[1] directly to convert the supernatant
                                    after centrifugation to high salt and low pH state, so that the plasmids in the supernatant could be adsorbed by the silica gel membrane.</p>
                                <p>To further improve the adsorption efficiency, we tried to activate the silica membrane in advance using Buffer PB[2] before using the silica membrane to adsorb the plasmid. In addition, we simulated the supernatant conditions
                                    after centrifugation of the bacterial broth with the configured 2×YT medium spiked with Amp antibiotics and compared the results with TE simulations and ddH2O simulations, and found that the supernatant purified by
                                    TE simulations and ddH2O simulations yielded approximately twice as many plasmids as 2×YT medium, and we speculate that the adsorption of proteins to plasmids contributed to this result.</p>

                                    30 μL Tris-EDTA buffer.</p>
                                <p>We then used a solution of phenol-chloroform isoamyl alcohol = 25:24:1 to remove the protein interference. In addition, to measure the efficiency of silica gel membrane and ethanol precipitation to obtain pure plasmids
                                    each, we compared the two methods using silica gel membrane and ethanol precipitation and found that the ethanol precipitation method was unstable, so we finally chose to use phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol precipitation
                                    followed by silica gel membrane to purify the plasmids.</p>

                                <p>​</p>
                                <p>In order to measure the ability of silica membranes to adsorb low concentrations of plasmids, we tested the ability of silica membranes to adsorb plasmids using a certain concentration of purified plasmids.</p>

                                <p>We tested our protocol in <i>E. coli</i> strains transformed with a low-copy plasmid (pET52b) and a high-copy plasmid (pmScarlet-C1), respectively. And we got good results for both low-copy and high-copy plasmids (Figure 4). What's more, we found the logarithmic phase of bacteriophage growth has a positive correlation with the autolysis.</p>

                                <p>Since our experiment requires induced expression of the target protein in BL21 (DE3) bacteria by IPTG, however, the induction process is highly susceptible to cellular autolysis due to the dual stress of reduced native expression and overexpression of the recombinant protein(Figure 5). We tried to find a balance between the two to determine the most suitable time to harvest the protein.</p>

                                <p>It is clear from the results that the viability of the bacteriophage decreases after IPTG induction. We recommend harvesting the bacteria at about 12 hours of incubation, which will  keep the product maximized and save resources.</p>

                                <p>We knew it was important that our protocol could be used by other people or other teams, so we invited the team in the lab next door to use our protocol and got relatively good results the same with ours.</p>
