                                <p>We conducted a series of SDG activities around women. The focus is on SDG5 -- gender equality, cooperation with SDG10 -- reducing inequality, SDG12 -- responsible production and consumption, SDG16 -- peace justice, and
                                    strong institutions. Our activities include organizing and studying the No Period Shaming Project on campus, debates on policies, holding feminism workshops, discussing and improving our project with entrepreneurs,
                                    designers, and other stakeholders. In addition, we studied the serious aging problem of Shanghai. We studied the right to get educated, especially intellectually disabled and elderly. Our sustainability studies focus
                                    on SDG5, and expanded into other SDGs, with detailed documentation for others to build on in future projects.</p>
                                <p>Our project on <em>Candida albicans</em> testing started with keywords including</p>
                                <p><strong>menstrual period and vaginal health.</strong></p>
                                <p>To achieve our goal, we design and improve our experiments, hoping that one day our paltry effort could help women get better informed of their vaginal health, without the shame of worldly prejudice or real-life difficulty
                                    caused by it. For most women in the world, vaginal health is of the same importance as intestinal health or respiratory tract health. They are all part of their body and worthy of equal attention, or even more attention
                                    if there’s something wrong with their health condition.</p>
                                <p>Not long did we realize that to achieve our goal or in other words get closer, we had to step out of the lab, walk into real life and get more people involved in our project.</p>
                                <p>In our process of observation, practice, and reflection, it dawned on us that seventeen <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong>(SDGs) are not isolated but concepts interwoven with each other in our own investigations,
                                    interviews, and debates.</p>
                                <p>As John Donn has put down the concept of universal relation in poetic words:</p>
                                <p><em>'No man is an island.'</em></p>
                                <p>The sociality of human beings has put everyone and everything in a universal relation. Sustainable Development Goals are no exception and being beautiful pursuits of human life, they are also part of the universal relation,
                                    which are interrelated and interactive. This is an insight we've learned about SDGs from our practice.</p>
                                <p>The main concern of our project is SDG5, <strong>Gender Equality</strong>, and other SDGs——SDG10, <strong>Reduced Inequality</strong>, SDG12, <strong>Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> and SDG16, <strong>Peace Justice and Strong Institutions</strong>                                    are also included.</p>

                                    to embrace the idea. Even though it’s just for emergencies like you’ve changed your bag and totally forgot your coming period. No Period Shaming is more than a helping hand in emergencies but spiritual support. Boys
                                    could never imagine how torturing period feels but for most girls, we have no choice but to suffer it, monthly.”</p>
                                <p>That’s exactly how I feel at the beginning of our story. But being a team, we soon realized that we could do more.</p>

                                <p>We distributed questionnaires to students randomly and collected 138 copies. Most of the interviewees are <strong>students taking course in school building within the scope of our activities.</strong></p>

                                <p>The questionnaire was distributed online and spread in WeChat groups by students of Fudan University. So, it might be the interviewees that had chosen us, with their <strong>concern and expectation to NPSP, trusting that we could make NPSP better</strong>.</p>

                                <p><em>A total of 138 questionnaires were collected, 120 of which met the requirement of &quot;having used women's restroom in teaching building of Handan Campus&quot;, and were recorded as group A. A total of 10 cases eligible for &quot;used sanitary napkins placed in toilets&quot; were marked as group B.</em></p>
                                <p><em><strong>For group A:</strong></em></p>
                                <p><em>94.17% of the students agreed that &quot;the humid environment of the toilet will breed pathogenic bacteria&quot;, (1.1)</em></p>
                                <p><em>70% of the students were worried about &quot;possible sanitary problems of mutual aid sanitary napkins&quot;, (1.2)</em></p>
                                <p><em>80% of the students had heard about &quot;diseases that may be caused by menstrual products that do not meet hygienic standards, such as toxic shock syndrome and vaginitis&quot;, (1.3)</em></p>
                                <p><em>On the five-point scale, the average score of our proposed &quot;quick and convenient detection method for small disc discoloration is adopted&quot; is 3.96, (1.4)</em></p>
                                <p><em>The average score of &quot;Whether the detection method will increase the possibility of students using sanitary napkins&quot; was 3.55, (1.5)</em></p>
                                <p><em>The average score for &quot;does our proposed test improve women's health?&quot; was 4.08. (1.6)</em></p>
                                <p><em><strong>For group B</strong></em> <em>(the sample size is relatively small)</em>:</p>
                                <p><em>One student found that the waterproof bag was not zipped properly when using sanitary napkins for mutual aid.</em></p>
                                <p><em>Four students put back their pads on the day, and six students put back their pads within three days,</em></p>
                                <p><em>On the five-point scale, the average score of &quot;rapid and convenient detection method of small disc discoloration was adopted&quot; proposed by us was 4.2, significantly higher than the average score of group A.</em></p>
                                <p><em>The average score of &quot;whether the detection method will increase the possibility of students using sanitary napkins for mutual aid&quot; was 3.8, which was also significantly higher than the average of group A.</em></p>
                                <p><em>The average score for &quot;can our proposed test further protect women's health?&quot; was 4.1, which was close to the average for group A.</em></p>

                                <p><em>Through simple analysis of the questionnaire, we believe that the safety of mutual sanitary napkins and even the health protection of women during menstruation is a local problem that has attracted widespread attention, especially among women. Therefore, we decide to take this as the direction and start looking for our solutions.</em></p>

                                <p><strong>Girls Helping Girls. Period. is a volunteer effort started by two New Jersey sisters, and their mom.</strong> Emma and Quinn and their family have always been active in volunteer work. GHGP started as a limited
                                    campaign of the girls' first volunteer group, Small Acts.</p>
                                <p>When the girls were just 13 and 17, Girls Helping Girls. Period. took on a life of its own-- they asked guests at a neighborhood party to bring a box of pads or tampons as a &quot;gift&quot; they would donate. Not only
                                    did their friends bring donations, but word spread, an article was written and within a few weeks the family's house was filled with boxes!</p>
                                <p>The &quot;girls&quot; of Girls Helping Girls. Period. work now as vice presidents of the organization that their mom, Elise, runs as executive director. Emma is an environmental science student at American University, and
                                    Quinn is headed to the University of Delaware to study in a health-related field. They continue to teach workshops, give talks, work on social media campaigns, communicate with donors, and pack products.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>What did we do?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We learned the way girls help girls in America and <strong>compared it with NPSP in Fudan</strong>. We reached the conclusion that GHGP was <strong>an example worth following</strong>, especially some problems that occurred
                                    as the enthusiasm of NPSP cooled down and spontaneous donation of menstrual products was used up. <strong>A beautifully decorated website with goodwill and deeds clearly illustrated on it might help NPSP find a more sustainable way to maintain. A better-organized structure with a reasonable division of labor can both guarantee the quality and extend the life of NPSP.</strong></p>

                                <p>Yang is a junior majoring biology. She was <strong>one of the organizers of No Period Shaming Project in Fudan</strong>.</p>

                                <p>On one hand, we should <strong>share the result of our questionnaire with NPSP organizers</strong>. On the other hand, we wanted to know <strong>more about stories behind NPSP</strong>, not just a few pads and a bag hanging
                                    on the toilet wall.</p>

                                <p>We listened to the story of No Period Shaming Prpject and were amazed at <strong>how difficult it was to do something about gender equality</strong>.</p>
                                <p><em><strong>(1) Failed attempt</strong></em></p>
                                <p><em>At the beginning, we sought the school’s documentary certificate and applied for the project in the fall, but the teacher temporarily repented and used humiliating language. But we believe that women should not be ashamed of mentioning health.</em></p>
                                <p><em>Then, we contacted Teacher Yan Chen from the School of Life Sciences, successfully participated in the online defense of the item, and got high marks, but the higher-level refused to show it publicly, and some other teachers took on security issues.

                                <p><em><strong>(2) Try again</strong></em></p>
                                <p><em>On the first weekend of November 2020, sealed bags were placed in two libraries and three teaching buildings, and they were put in the sanitary ware, and placed in the small box (starting to put 5-10 sanitary napkins, Write the card and when to put it in) We wrote the label to prevent worry.</em></p>
                                <p><em><strong>(3) Feedback</strong></em></p>
                                <p><em>The installation of one of the teaching buildings was removed at noon that day. The property stated that it must be certified by the school. Some of the library is used, and some students put it in again. The sanitary napkins in the other teaching building were put in by the classmates of social work. The cleaning aunt felt very good, and only removed it after a few weeks.</em></p>

Besides, she is <strong>an influencing feminist on stream media</strong>                                    like Bilibili and Podcast, especially popular among the generation after the 80s and 90s.</p>

                                <p>Our team member first encountered Prof. Shen on Podcast. We listened to her program and really got <strong>interested in feminism</strong>. So, it was really surprising to find her name on our courses. As an old Chinese

                                <p>The course on Culture of Vision and Gender really gave us <strong>a brand new perspective</strong>. And the poster was a practice about how we imply the perspective to reflect our daily life.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Why did we choose the topic?</li>

                                <p>Reflection on daily life is an important part of contemporary feminist studies. Through Shen's course, we realized that <strong>things we take for granted in our daily life are the products of many social and cultural factors.</strong></p>

                                <p>The <strong>impact of the patriarch is everywhere</strong> though we don’t even notice. The poster is organized in the order of age and biological gender, and divided into two domains, public(white) or private(black).</p>
                                <p>We found this was a great way to hold ourselves to account for acting throughout the day. Only through prolonged and occasional meditation can we <strong>achieve the grace of implementing the feminist perspective in every aspect of life</strong>.</p>

                                    <li><em>Through the workshop, I understand that women should be respected by us. What impresses me most is the current social responsibility of women, which makes me better understand the value and significance of women to society.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>Through the workshop, I found that the only person responsible for women's fate can be women themselves. Truly and objectively understand your situation, understand your weaknesses and limitations, and accept them to a certain extent.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>My understanding of the definition of feminism is to recognize the mystery of women's physiology and psychology, pursue gender equality, and encourage women to pursue individual survival feeling preferences and live their own life.</em></li>
                                    <li><em>For women, since the matriarchal clan era was replaced by the paternal clan era, they have basically been in a subordinate position in this society.</em></li>
                                    <li><em><strong>Women are not born but shaped.</strong></em></li>
                                    <li><em>Femininity is a result of domination and a reflection of women's own situation. Women themselves are also complicit in this domination.

                                <p>In 1960, Israel announced the capture of Adolf Eichmann, the former Nazi German official known as the &quot;executor,&quot; and his trial in Jerusalem in 1961. Hannah Arendt (Barbara Sukowa), a famous Jewish philosopher
                                    who has lived in the United States for many years, is invited by The New Yorker to contribute to the trial. When Hannah Arendt went to Jerusalem to watch the trial, she found a gap between Eichmann's narrative, public
                                    opinion, and her own philosophical thinking. As Arendt raised Eichmann's actions to a philosophical level, her essay predictably provoked criticism, with some of Hannah Arendt's old friends breaking with her. The female
                                    protege under Heidegger wanted to retreat in the storm but found that everything was not as simple as they expected.</p>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Feminism-related films can be a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the topic and thought-provoking to those who are interested in the topic.</p>

                                    <li>What did we learn?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Film recommendation was initially designed for men around us. However, it wasn’t because of the gender perspective that makes feminism worth learning but because of its tolerant and inclusive nature.</p>
                                <p>Here are some feedbacks from our friends and classmates.</p>
                                <p><em>Zhu:</em></p>
                                <p><em>As a biographical film, the film itself should not focus on one typical event to unfold the character of the subject. Hence, it’s intelligible that apart from detailing the trial of Eichmann, the director depicted a gathering talk at the beginning and cozy acts of Hannah and her husband, which interspersed the movie. Besides being a tough thinker, Hannah was a person who cherished friendship and a wife who deeply loved her spouse, also longing for endearments.</em></p>
                                <p><em>When we shift back to the trial, a stunning trick that ought to be mentioned is that the filmmaker shows the original videotape and the scene of Hannah’s response alternately, more explicitly demonstrating the scenario while meantime leaving space for the audience to ‘think’ independently. However, crime couldn’t easily be calculated as punishment and it was unfair to accuse a ‘spike’ of the sin of a whole system. Understanding doesn’t equal forgiving, but it’s a way for us to seek out the underlying ethical or philosophical problems undermining our society and avoid repeating the pain without thorough reflection.</em></p>
                                <p><em>What is evil? The end told everyone this question bothered Hannah till she died. The core of Hannah’s theory was the ability to think and it was because of the lack of it that made Eichmann commit a crime, carrying the banality of evil. She called Eichmann a ‘nobody’, giving up thinking and mechanically performing his duty. During Nuremberg Trials, the war criminals claimed to have followed the law and they shouldn’t be punished. If there was something wrong, it should be the law itself. Never had anyone abandoned thinking without reasons, so it’s not enough to only discuss the concept of non-person. Is a bad law a law? Socrates tried to preserve the authority of law, but dramatically he died because of a bad law. We can’t say Socrates is also a ‘nobody’ in that he thought over before accepting the proceedings. The authority of law decides the stability of a nation, but the law should also present a kind of justice deriving from public order and morals. When the law offends justice to an extent that hurts and erodes humanity, the law will be illegal law, losing its validity. Who are to inspect the law? I suppose it should be ourselves. Keeping on thinking protects the completeness of our individuality and revises the law that normalizes society.</em></p>

                                <p><em>There is no doubt that the Age of Awakening, as a tribute to the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, can be said to be excellent. The portrayal of the characters by the old opera and the new generation is very vivid, and the scenes and habits of the characters also make people have a sense of generation. Looking at the awakening era from a personal perspective, it is also to make the process of the founding of the Communist Party of China come alive from the history books. However, as a tribute, it certainly has many shortcomings.</em></p>
                                <p><em>One is the concealment of the criticism of the characters. Of course, this is understandable for a tribute film, but it will also mislead some audiences, for example, why Chen Duxiu's two sons call his wife aunt, is because she was the sister of Chen’s former wife, being intellectuals, they shared more opinions and love came in time, they finally eloped together. This is not shown at all in the play except for the title.</em></p>
                                <p>**<em>What impressed me most was the neglect of the portrayal of women. The male characters are all vividly portrayed, while female characters are nothing but attachment, plainly put, just lovers of the male characters. Here are really a lot of examples, the elder generation, Gao Junman, and Chen Duxiu, Zhao Renlan and Li Dazhao, Jiang Dongxiu and Hu Shi, the younger generation, Liu Mei and Chen Yannian, Bai Lan and Guo Xingang, Yi Qunxian and He Mengxiong. However, a lack of female portrayal is the biggest problem I think. Being an intellectual though, Kao Junman was just positioned as Chen Duxiu's good wife in the whole film, and she was not smart enough to be with Chen Duxiu as a talent who knows him well. Gao Junman, Zhao Renlan, and Jiang Dongxiu are all portrayed on the identity of the &quot;wife&quot;, while Liu and Bai are also depicted in a bond with Chen and Guo, without whom they almost do not appear. It's fair to say they're fictional characters, so they're not. However, at that time, there was no lack of women worthy of portrayal, but the drama always lacked such a woman who was portrayed as the main supporting role with an independent personality, which was a very uncomfortable and regrettable deficiency of this drama.</em></p>

                                <p>When we talked to <strong>our advisor</strong> about the product design, she <strong>recommended Relief</strong>. We joined the customer WeChat group chat of Relief, attended an online Relief women empowerment workshop,
                                    and kept in touch with Emma Chen.</p>

                                <p>We hope to learn the experience of design for women from an established brand like Relief to help improve our design. Besides, we <strong>shared the same ideas like women empowerment, responsible consumption, and other feministic issues like &quot;no period shame&quot; and &quot;reducing menstrual poverty&quot;.</strong>                                    Also, our team members were very much inspired by the quote of Relief, &quot;make menstruation cooler!&quot;</p>
                                <p>We consulted Emma, the founder, through WeChat and got advice on commercialization and marketing. She told us that her target group was the millennials, feature of which was a ceaseless curiosity for new stuff. Being an
                                    80s, she also shared <strong>some insight with us about her generation and the 90s</strong>. So, we really had an overview of business for women and for the post-80s. With the success of Relief, Emma illustrated that
                                    a good story could help us a lot if we would like to commercialize our project. Lastly, <strong>beauty premium</strong> was what we should spend effort on. <strong>A plain box wouldn’t be appealing to any woman today and it should be both utility-oriented and beauty-oriented. Our improvement was to change the color of the kit or put some relative comics on the kit.</strong></p>

The team put boxes into machines that were innovative for the time (vending machines are more widely used today) and a successful project</em></p>
                                <p><em>The only question is the actual participation rate of the specific purchase/gift of the project, I don't know (you can search it online).</em></p>
                                <p><em>According to your design, there is another scene that is also suitable for me: domestic production inspection. Namely, at least one vaginal test during pregnancy. My case is: it is very tiring to wait in line for the equality test in the hospital during late pregnancy. After a process, I feel that there is no need to go to the hospital (the hospital is crowded) if there is a simple test paper</em></p>
                                <p><em>Another professional question: I found out I was pregnant in Singapore, and I bought two boxes of pregnancy tests, which can measure the exact period in the first trimester (down to a few weeks). I don't know what the latest science on the test paper was, but it felt very advanced. I also communicated with my friends in China, but they said that this kind of pregnancy test has not appeared on the market</em></p>
                                <p><em>There was a time when people thought I had a bad memory when I was pregnant, but it's true</em></p>
                                <p><em>Then I would like to combine some of my own experience in women's products with the following suggestions (I am a businessman so I think more about economic questions) :</em></p>
                                <p><em>Whether the funds and resources you invested in the early stage can be effectively and forcefully supported, and whether the specific amount is enough for you to make a demo (complete product experience test)</em></p>
                                <p><em>Specific and clear market positioning (for people). Whether it is a public welfare route or a capital accumulation route, the direction should be clear, which is more helpful to future development (team development)</em></p>
                                <p><em>Your design can be developed in two ways (personal suggestion): In China, women's issues are still wandering among first-tier cities. We can try to integrate some pure design flows and take a conceptual display route of design concepts (such as cooperation with art centers). Secondly, we can implement physical products, that is, make your products available to the hospitals in the village and the people who need them the most.</em></p>
                                <p><em>Also, I haven't query data, but this kind of design should not be your sole, so what is your team's core competitiveness, have not been with a category instead of the advantages of (this don't try so hard, can do slowly found) if you can go to the end, fully implement the plan, your advantage is that a few of you (it is difficult to achieve, Most teams just walk away)</em></p>
                                <p><em>In addition, in the initial production/market of any product there are only two ways :(1) a way of small profits and quick sales (business logic, specific not to expand) can use the least cost, the fastest speed to do the largest scale promotion. (2) Small but refined, this choice takes time in terms of manpower, material resources, and energy. It is a road in line with China's future market, but difficult to take (all categories are being upgraded at present).</em></p>
                                <p><em>Lastly, it is impossible to find the most suitable partner (physical materials) for any project at the very beginning. You can cast a wide net to catch the big fish.</em></p>
                                <p><em>This one depends on your luck, but also your strength. The world is fair, big carrot for the big hole.</em></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Who are they?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Two debate teams participated was from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.</strong> Medical background enables two teams to see menstruation issues
                                    more objectively, or in other words, with fewer prejudices. We hope that there will be fewer biases in such a debate, and increase thinking depth in the activity of no period shame.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Why did we choose the topic?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The debate is proposed by our team. The idea came from 《<strong>Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill》, which was voted by the Scottish parliament</strong> on November 24, 2020. Passage of the bill means that
                                    public places in Scotland, including primary and secondary schools and universities, will provide free menstrual products, and local government and education institutions will be obliged to guarantee a free supply of
                                    Menstrual products.</p>
                                <p><strong>We wanted to discuss to what extent could the bill apply to China.</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What did we learn in the debate?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><em>The main points of pro are as follows:</em></p>
                                <p><em>1. The poor tend to choose cheap menstrual products because of economic burdens.</em></p>
                                <p><em>2. It is sub-quality or improperly stored menstrual products that lead to a higher risk of gynecological diseases.</em></p>
                                <p><em>3. Women are burdened by physical differences that could lead to gender poverty.</em></p>
                                <p><em>The solution they proposed was that, for the upstream, lower down the price through the centralized procurement with a quality guarantee, and for the downstream, the school should play a role in completing the distribution of free menstrual products to student groups, the street committee, and village cadres should cover the other group in need. The main advantage of the scheme is that qualified menstrual products can greatly reduce the incidence of gynecological diseases, which are represented by <i>Candida albicans</i>, and the total cost, in general, could be less than the total treatment fee. Besides the scheme can promote gender equality, and make women better exert their own potential, and create their own value. But the problem is that centralized procurement can lead to a decline in quality or corruption.</em></p>
                                <p><em>The main points of the opposite are as follows:</em></p>
                                <p><em>1. The executive force may not be able to achieve the desired results and could instead easily breed corruption.</em></p>
                                <p><em>2. That may cause a waste of resources.</em></p>
                                <p><em>3. A major cultural factor of menstrual poverty is the bad tradition of “value the male child only”, and the legislation of menstrual products might be near enough nowhere.</em></p>
                                <p><em>The target solution is to include the period items in health care or tax breaks to reduce the price of menstrual products. But the problem is that tax breaks may have little effect and not really make some poor families affordable. The idea of inclusion in health care is more feasible.</em></p>
                                <p><em>Although the two sides are in a different position because of the pros and cons of the debate, they are thinking about the crucial issues of menstrual poverty and gender equality, and the opinions on key issues are consistent: we need to act for women's menstrual poverty, especially in the macro level of politics. For women in China, especially in underdeveloped areas, women are better able to accept education and self-fulfillment, and we can do a lot more.</em></p>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Prof. <strong>Shen Ke</strong> was an expert on population policy and intergenerational relationships and has published several influential articles on <em>Population and Development Review</em>,

                                <p>We interviewed Prof. Ke Shen after her online lecture named <strong>The mixed blessing of living together or close by, which was an insightful observation about China's gender policy and culture</strong>.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What did we learn?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Prof. Shen illustrated her findings of women’s labor participation rate and filial responsibility with solid statistics.</p>
                                <p>She mentioned <strong>the impact of the Opening and Reform Policy on women's employment ensuring policy</strong>. Before the policy was implemented, all work was distributed to certain groups of people and gender didn’t
                                    play much of a role in the distribution process. However, the policy led to market-oriented reform, therefore all got their job through market competition, in which men won advantage over women in most cases. For instance,
                                    if a woman gives birth to a child and takes maternity leave, she might be denied an opportunity to promote or further study accordingly. On the other hand, men seldom take their paternity leave in China. That’s <strong>where inequality comes in</strong>.</p>
                                <p>We got a gender view on the seemingly glorious Opening and Reform policy and learned that inequality might be created even it was long thought to be a good-willed policy. <strong>Policymakers should be reflective when there is a gender imbalance among them</strong>.</p>
