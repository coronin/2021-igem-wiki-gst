We are competing for the Best Part Collection Special Prize. We are explaining how all our parts form a collection on http://2021.igem.org/Team:Fudan/Parts

Our parts could be divided into three major groups:

(I) parts that were designed to regulate the bacteria expression, including the first full characterized σS promoter http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3790014 for the iGEM community, as well as parts were used for validation.

<pre>Group I: BBa_K3790014,
BBa_K3790009 - BBa_K3790013, BBa_K3790086,
BBa_K3790050, BBa_K3790085,
BBa_K3790231, BBa_K3790235,
BBa_K3790225 - BBa_K3790230, BBa_K3790236, BBa_K3790237, BBa_K3790242</pre>

(II) a set of DNA binding domains that could be used to improve polymerases, including our favorite Sso7d http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3790002

<pre>Group II: BBa_K3790002,
BBa_K3790001, BBa_K3790003, BBa_K3790004, BBa_K3790005, BBa_K3790006</pre>

(III) IPTG induced Bst polymerase for isothermal DNA amplification, as well as a complete set of fusions with parts in b. We showed that even without improvement, native Bst produced in bacterial lysate is sufficient to support LAMP, documented in http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3790212

<pre>Group III: BBa_K3790212,
BBa_K3790213 - BBa_K3790224,
BBa_K3790150 - BBa_K3790162</pre>

This page lists all the parts we built for our project. Please check each part's Main Page on the Registry http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page

Updated on 2021-11-18: We are keeping figures and text in the Registry as it was. You might found https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/0/00/T--Fudan--figures4-prepared-for-zoom.pdf (which we prepared for the Judging Session) helpful to understand our parts.
