                                <p>The idea of developing a software tool focus on parts inter-relationship origins from our experiment design. When our team started our design, we first focus on gp2-a protein that may satisfy our bio-circuit demands. But
                                    as our experiment went on, we found that gp2 was not as suitable as we desired. Let's call the challenge we met as &quot;gp2 Puzzle&quot; for now. At that moment, we urged to find a basic part, which shares a similar
                                    function with gp2, or a regulatory part tested with gp2 before, or an improved part based on gp2.</p>
                                <p>But after browsing the whole community search tools and official part tools, we failed to find one which can be capable of this mission. Thus, we decided to build one software tool which not only can show relevant parts
                                    directly but also gives out the most demanded details about a part for a wet lab experiment designer.</p>

                                </ol>
                                <p>Our software actually helped us find one resolution for the &quot;gp2 puzzle&quot;. With the searching function, we found BBa_K1893016(pBAD + gp2). With its already-made inducing condition data, we successfully find the
                                    desirable inducing conditions and made gp2 works without time-wasting testing or, giving up gp2——which means throwing our design and ideas as trash.</p>

                                <p>When we are about to register our parts, we use Part Camera for a reconfirmation of reptation. We let our part go through blast modules. Take BBa_K3790086 as an example, our results data show the overlappings with the exact
                                    parts before with their part BBa ID, which CANNOT be found in iGEM official blast results and part imfos on their pages. implying that our research results can be added to iGEM part information as a supplementary.</p>

                                <p>We found many similar parts with IDs( marked by a red box) that are not shown from official BLAST tools.</p>
                                <h1 id="about-our-software-tool-part-camera"><a class="anchor" href="#about-our-software-tool-part-camera">#</a> Our Software: Part Camera</h1>
                                <p>Part Camera is a search engine for the iGEM part repository developed by python. The keyword most distinct our software tool from the others is ‘Links Between Parts’. We focus on analyzing and demonstrating the relationships
                                    between parts, thus giving users ideas on how this part can be used and how to create a new efficient composite part with potential linking part, besides a brief view of the basic information the experiment designers
                                    desired most.</p>
                                <p>Part Camera contains two major pillars: the database containing whole parts info and the functional functions ready to be called by an interface.</p>
                                <p>The database is set by a crawler using selenium, a package for web testing, enabling us to reach detailed information of registered parts, including the part's id(e.g BBa_K3790086), part's sequence, part's description,
                                    etc. It is worth mentioning that we also place in some potential features that cannot be got directly from part wiki such as citations between parts, used times, and so on. These features also show the links between
                                    parts and the significance of a part. Meanwhile, we use fp-growth algorithm to find the potential links of two parts without direct links based on their citations. And our database is saved in .fasta, .json and .xlsx
                                    modes, making it easy for both reading and processing from programs and direct check from users.</p>
                                <p>The functional modules embedded in our interface are mainly BLAST and TreeMap. The previous one is a commonly used algorithm for finding similar sequence, and now it is used to enable Part Camera’s searching for sequences.
                                    And the latter one is an interactable TreeMap generated by Pyecharts. TreeMap allows users to have an intuitive view of the relations between parts. All functions and data are integrated into our interface. With a server,
                                    everyone can access Part Camera through the internet, or you can reach Part Camera through GitHub.</p>

                                <p>In the design part, in order to have a more straightforward image of our whole program, we will take a search for BBa_K3606036 in a user's view and track the whole data flow as an example to show you how a searching process
                                    is done.</p>

                                <p>Before the search is started, some preparations have to be done——set the database. But usually, users don't need to do this on their computer since 2021 iGEM Team Fudan will help you set the Database and you may just reach
                                    them on Github or the linkings at the end of this page! see more in the ''Get our data here&quot; section.</p>
                                <p>File 'get_parts_data.py' is specially designed for setting the database, when being run, the central part -Module Selenium starts to work. Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers, which allows us to get
                                    the original data for each part.</p>
                                <p>At the very beginning, we chose to use the Request module for requesting data, but after consulting our mentor, we realized that Request may burden iGEM's server, and Selenium, which serves as a web automatic testing tool,
                                    can avoid laying much stress on iGEM’s websites. Moreover, we also set timers to control the request frequency.</p>
                                <p>With the help of elements' paths, we may easily get the information we need. We started by getting the list of parts registered for each year's team and then reached every part's wiki for more details. After this procedure
                                    now we know BBa_K3606036's information as the following table. By doing this step repeatedly, we have more than 40'000 parts' detail. By saving them in excels, our original database is set now.</p>

                                <p>Fp-growth (frequent pattern tree) is an algorithm designed for data mining and machine learning, which is an effective way to find frequent itemsets and without candidate itemset generation. In this case, we use fp-growth
                                    to find the most frequently used parts in pairs. Fp-growth helps to expose the deep usage of parts, may help users to determine how to use the target parts. Due to the limitation of arithmetic power, we only wrote the
                                    module, more computing power is needed in practical usage.</p>

                                    This is done by the Participle Method and the results are sorted by relevance, so usually, you may find your most desired on the top of results.</p>

                                    modes are the most tested ones and may best competently present data with a quick scanning. Thus, we imitate the presenting style of google and write a google-like web page. When searching for BBa_K3606036, the web
                                    calls backstage python file to return a few compliant parts lists and searches for details based on this list. We also have a quick show of our core feature——relationship. At the top of part blocks, we add short tags
                                    or parts, these tags may not have obvious connections with the searching ones, but they have potential links or similar usage (for example, RFP may be one tag when searching for GFP), which are gotten by Keyword Algorithm.
                                    you may click and know more about these related parts and have inspirations when browsing.</p>

                                <p>As is introduced before, fp-growth exposes the most frequently used parts in pairs. The design of distribution kits may refer to this result, for example, linking frequently used pairs in one plasmid to save wells of plates,
