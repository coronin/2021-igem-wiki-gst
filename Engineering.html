                                <p>Phages are known to be capable of reducing the expression of the chassis biological background proteins. We reviewed the literature and found that the T7 phage could achieve this through three proteins, gene protein (gp)
                                    0.7, gp2 and gp5.7 . Gp0.7 and gp2 are proteins that function early during phage infection, while gp5.7 is a highly active protein in the middle of the phage infection. Phages can suppress the expression of native proteins
                                    early in the infection, and thus we believe that gp5.7 plays a complementary function to the gp2 protein, and that gp2 may has a stronger effect of reducing the background protein expression level. Therefore, we initially
                                    entailed gp2 in our circuits. As for gp0.7, it is reported as a broad-spectrum protein kinase and therefore can inhibit RNAP while interfering with the function of many other proteins, and we were aleither not sure
                                    if it would affect the target protein (Bst in our case). Besides, Gp0.7 has a large molecular weight. The host bacterium is under more stress when expressing it, so we did not select gp0.7. In contrast, gp2 is a relatively
                                    small molecular weight protein, with only 198 amino acids. For the above reasons, we chose gp2 to act as the inhibitor of background protein in our engineering bacteria.</p>
                                <p>However, leakage is also a severe problem that we predicted to encounter. To prevent the leakage of gp2 protein and inhibiting the growth of host bacteria before induction, we chose a medium copy of replication start and
                                    p15A Ori[1] and a low leakage promoter pBAD [2]. in our circuits.</p>

                                <p>We synthesized gp2 directly with Oligo Assembly for it is a small protein, P15A ori from the plysS plasmid, and pBAD sourced from the Distribution Kit our team received in 2019. we then used Overlab PCR and homologous recombination
                                    to ligate these fragments together and obtain a complete loop capable of fulfilling the intended function of the plasmid. In addition, to characterize the amount of heteroprotein, we obtained a plasmid with pCVD as
                                    a vector attached to a σ70 constitutive promoter controlling GFP expression. These two plasmids were cotransfected with Fast T1 <em>E. coli</em> (a modified version of DH5α) to obtain <em>E. coli</em> for culture.</p>

                                <p>We obtained <em>E. coli</em> successfully transformed with a functional plasmid and then cultured. We added 0, 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM arabinose at the absorbance OD600 of 0.2, and continued to incubate the bacteria,
                                    and measured the OD600 and GFP fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength 488 nm, emission wavelength 530 nm) at half-hour intervals for 12 h. The results showed that the growth status and the expression of GFP in
                                    the bacterium under different level of induction were quite similar, indicating that the background protein has strongly inhibited the transcription of <i>E. coli</i> without induction,.We speculated that our anti-leakage
                                    measures failed to completely prevent the leakage of gp2.</p>

                                <p>We learned that the function of gp2 was too strong that even minor leakage will severely affect the growth of our engineering bacteria.</p>
                                <p>To solve the problem that the repressor protein strongly inhibits <i>E. coli</i> transcription even without induction, due to its leakage expression, we can on the one hand try to optimize the anti-leakage element, and on the
                                    other hand, reduce the function of the repressor protein so that it won't cause notable effects when not induced even there's some leakage.</p>

                                <p>We think it's more practical to reduce the function of the repressor protein being expressed. To realize this, we chose gp5.7 to substitute for gp2, because gp5.7 is mainly a σS inhibitor, which can only slightly inhibit
                                    σ70.Even if the leakage of σS cause uncontrollable inhibition to transcription during growth plateau, it doesn't matter since the cell density has reached the up-limit. So, this design can well solve the problem of
                                    over-functioning transcriptional repressor protein.</p>

                                    expression (no matter it's driven by σ70 or σS) of the organism without induction and with different concentrations of induction. It proved that we reached the goal that the expression of the native protein could be

                                <p>However, after more than two months of shooting and seeking help from various parties, including support from NEB, we still could not solve the problem that the signal of the amplification bands of the commercial tHDA kit
                                    was extremely weak and difficult to detect.</p>

                                <p>When we contacted customer service, we were told that the tHDA amplification bands were just very weak and our experiments found it difficult to use the tHDA amplification products for subsequent LFA experiments, so we
                                    switched to other isothermal amplification methods.</p>

                                <p>We interviewed Prof. <a href="https://life.fudan.edu.cn/e7/3d/c28175a386877/page.htm" target="_blank">Yongming Wang</a>, whose research interest includes combining LAMP with CRISPR Cas9 to carry out detections.</p>
                                <p>According to Prof. Wang’s insight, LAMP and RPA are potentially better alternatives to our tHDA method. When testing RNA viruses, rt-RPA was shown to yield false-positive results, while LAMP is relatively more sensitive
                                    and cost-efficient.</p>

                                <p>We noticed that tHDA requires two types of enzymes, decarboxylase, and polymerase, both of which are temperature sensitive - there is no reliable route to transport to rural regions. We then want to produce and improve
                                    enzymes using synthetic biology methods, we turned our attention to LAMP, the simplest enzyme, which amplifies much more efficiently than tHDA, and although its primers are more complex, it also has better reaction
                                    specificity, recognizing six nucleic acid fragments specifically.</p>
