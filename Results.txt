                                <p>First, to affirm the system could work properly, we started from the very beginning by testing the availability of our primers and the DNA extracted from <i>Candida albicans</i> by our instructor following safety rules. As Figure 1
                                    indicates, we got positive results with both agarose gel electrophoresis and LFA.</p>

                                <p>Next, we tried to define the conditions to carry out the detection, including the detection limit, the minimum amount of enzyme required in the reaction, reaction time, and temperature. The reaction time available is above
                                    70 mins. The reaction temperature ranges from 60-65 °C. The minimum amount of enzyme catalyzing LAMP is 2 U/25μl, and the detection limit of <em>C. albicans</em> using LAMP is 0.4 pg/μl. 0.4 pg/μl.</p>

                                <p>In our project, the T7 gene product circuit is used to inhibit the endogenous transcription of <i>E. coli</i>, thus enhancing the purity of the protein of interest. To test T7 gp2 and gp5.7, which are respectively known as σ70
                                    inhibitor and σS inhibitor, we must first construct σS promoters for following testing.</p>

                                <p>Six σS promoters core region sequences are tested using growth curve measurement and flourescence intensity curve measurement protocol.</p>

                                <p>All of the six sequences are proved to be σS promoters that can function independently. Among them, pdps shows the highest strength as a σS promoter.</p>

                                <p>In our project, the T7 expression system (based on the pET52 plasmid) was used to express the large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase I (large fragment), which is required for the isothermal amplification reaction (LAMP to

                                <p>Our Bst (or previously called BstPol) is derived from the DNA polymerase I large fragment in Bacillus stearothermophilus. The large fragment of Bst DNA Polymerase I contains 5' to 3' DNA polymerase activity and strong strand
                                    displacement activity, but lacks 5' to 3' exonuclease activity, ideal for target sequence amplification.</p>

                                <p>We obtained the Bst polymerase large fragment coding DNA optimized for <i>Escherichia coli</i> codon from Twist Bioscience, by total synthesis. We have the pET backbone in our laboratory stocks (namely pET16, pET28 and pET52;
                                    all of three shared the same backbone sequence used in our experiments).</p>
                                <p>We used ClonExpress® Homologous Recombination Kit from Vazyme to perform PCR based cloning, placing Bst (Figure 1) between T7 RBS and T7 terminator. Homology arm primers used are documented at the Design page.</p>

                                <p>The Bst DNA polymerase I large fragment coding DNA is sized at 1764bp, which is approximately 1800bp after adding homology arms to both ends by PCR reaction. The result (Figure 1) shows a successful amplification of the

                                <p>In our project, we wanted to <strong>make certain modifications to the DNA polymerase of the LAMP reaction</strong>t<strong>o improve its relevant activity and thus the detection limit and precision of the test strips we designed.</strong>                                    In the course of previous studies, we found that the addition of sso7d double-stranded binding protein tended to increase the activity of DNA polymerase, but there is a lack of relevant literature on sso7d to increase
                                    the activity of Bst Pol. Therefore we ventured to hypothesize that sso7d could enhance Bst Pol activity, and we selected three similar double-stranded binding proteins from the same species as sso7d, Sulfolobus solfataricus.
                                    Also, to verify whether single-chain binding proteins also have similar effects, two single-chain binding proteins from Sulfolobus solfataricus and E. coli, respectively, were selected for the experiment. We also considered
                                    that different binding sites of the binding proteins to the polymerase might lead to different results, and therefore we designed whether the binding proteins are attached to the C- or N-terminal end of Bst Pol, respectively.</p>
                                <p>To construct the fusion proteins, we need to obtain the DNA of Bst Pol and the six binding proteins and ligate Bst Pol and the six binding proteins in the designed positions by homologous recombination.</p>
